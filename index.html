    <h1>Project on console</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity). Begin your journey with VS Code with these <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos">introductory videos</a> on visual studio official website. </p>
    <p>Getting up and running with Visual Studio Code is quick and easy. It is a small download so you can install in a matter of minutes and give VS Code a try.</p>
    <h3>Steps to follow</h3>
    <p>1st. Download the Visual Studio Code installer for Windows.</p>
    <p>2nd. Once it is downloaded, run the installer <kbd>(VSCodeUserSetup-{version}.exe)</kbd>. This will only take a minute.</p>
    <p>3rd.  By default, VS Code is installed under <kbd>C:\users\{username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code</kbd>.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, you can also download a <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=winzip">Zip archive</a>, extract it and run Code from there.</p>
    <p><b>Note: .NET Framework 4.5.2 or higher is required for VS Code. If you are using Windows 7, make sure you have at least .NET Framework 4.5.2 installed. You can check your version of .NET Framework using this command, <kbd>reg query "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\full" /v</kbd> version from a command prompt.</b></p>
    <p><b>Tip: Setup will add Visual Studio Code to your <kbd>%PATH%</kbd>, so from the console you can type 'code .' to open VS Code on that folder. You will need to restart your console after the installation for the change to the <kbd>%PATH%</kbd> environmental variable to take effect.</b></p>

    <h2>About console</h2>
    <p>In computer technology, a console can mean different things depending on the context. It usually means a combination of a display monitor and an input device, usually a keyboard and mouse pair, which allows a user to input commands and receive visual output from a computer or computer system. It can also refer to specialized computers only meant to play video games.</p>
